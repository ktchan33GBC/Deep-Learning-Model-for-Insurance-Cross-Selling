# Deep Learning Model for Insurance Cross Selling



Problem statement:

The insurance industry has seen a rapid increase in the adoption of deep learning techniques to drive their cross-selling strategies. The goal of this project is to explore the impact of optimizer , learning rate and batch size on the accuracy and convergence of a deep learning model designed to support an insurance company's cross-selling strategy.

We used the recall score as our metrics , because we would like to minimize the false negative result and enhance the true positive result so as to upselling more customers to buy the vehicle insurance.
